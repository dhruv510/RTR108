1) first we have to run http.py file then open ngrok application in that we have to type "ngrok http 8000" after that we will get result like  that our session is online
and then go to the google chrome or any other browser type in search bar "http://localhost:8000/product.html"  so we get result that we are on web page. 

2) i upload ngrok application because i thought that you can check my whole work and without ngrok application
it's  not possible that's why i uploaded ngrok application and also i don't want to hide something from you regarding my tasks.....
